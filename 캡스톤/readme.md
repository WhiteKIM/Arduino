## What is Internet Of Umbrella
On a rainy day. Have you ever arrived home in the rain because you couldn't bring an umbrella? Then this will be a very good measure for you. It is an IOT product that helps you not forget to take an umbrella and analyzes the weather by yourself and suggests a solution suitable for you.
## How to use this Code
1. Connect Any Device for your Arduino Board - Please Check Pin Number in Code
2. Next input FireBase ID, password in code, and This code use Korea Weather forecast Service API. So You get the API Key and Input API Key to this code
3. Download Library And move file to C:/User/UserName/Document/Arduino/library
4. Connect Board to Computer And Upload code
5. Enjoy
## How to Test
This Code run on Rainy Weather Day and Sensing Water Sensor, IR Sensor. I Add test Code so 
## Using Library
1. ESP8266FireBase
2. Pitches
3. ArduinoJson
4. WiFiESP
